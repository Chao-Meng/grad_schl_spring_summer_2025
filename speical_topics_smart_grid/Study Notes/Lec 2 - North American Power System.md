- With traditional power generation, we have a large generation system and power flows through the loads. North American power systems are interconnected.
- Production in USA is much higher with around 4,055 Terra Watt Hours. Canada was only 500ish.
- Lots of interconnection between US and Canada. We are better connected North/South vs East/West.'
- There is now a push to go East/West that is being talked about.
- Import and export of power between US and Canada. Manitoba, Ontario, etc. export a large amount. BC, AB, SK, etc. import more than export.
- NERC background knowledge: Covered in slides
	- Very strict rules and trade agreements that need to be followed and maintained. There are eight reliability entities within the system which looks at the reliability within each area (8 areas), which is then reported to NERC. 
	- NPCC, FRCC, ERCOT, RFC, MRO, WECC, SERC, SPP, ASCC
- Hdro Quebec sits on its own. It is not synchronized because it only has DC lines going, so it is asynchronously connected to NPCC.
- Similarly, ERCOT connected via dc lines. Same with quebec and alberta. They are not synchronoized so they need DC connection.
- 26 lines going into US.
- IESO manages the market and also makes sure the system is reliably operated. So it manages the settlements and financial operations of $13 Billion wholesale market.
